Problem description:
Say we have a X GB log file and a Y GB RAM, where X << Y. We want to sort the log file based on timestamps.
Note: one can only sort a file when it is tucked in a RAM; impossible to scale the RAM>

Solution (external sort):
1. Divide the log file into chunks of size X GB (size of RAM)
2. Sort each chunk in RAM one by one and save in hard drive
3. Apply technique 'Merge K sorted list'

Time complexity: O(C*SlogS + C*SlogC) -- merge sort on C chunks + merge C sorted lists
Space comlaxity: O(C)
C -- number of chunks; number of sorted lists
S -- numbe rof elements in each chunk
CS -- total of entries in each file
