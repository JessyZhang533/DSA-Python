Stability in sorting algorithms  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJuxI1BBLyQ

1. What is stability:
Say we have two identical values in the original list, denoted as value-1 and value-2 (1 and 2 indicates which one is first inserted).
Now we apply a sorting algorithms to the list.
After sorting, if value-1 is still placed before value-2, we say the sorting algorithm is stable. Otherwise it is unstable.

2. What makes a sorting algorithm unstable:
Swaps of non-adjacent elements.
Merge, Insertion, Counting Sort: no swaps --> stable
Bubble Sort: Only adjacent swaps --> stable
Quick, Heap, Selection Sort: unstable

3. Impossibility trinity for comparison sorts:
(1) time complexity O(nlogn); (2) extra space O(1); (3) Stability
One sorting algorithm can only satisfy two of the three.
(1)(2): Quick, Heap Sort
(1)(3): Merge Sort
(2)(3): Insertion, Bubble Sort
(2): Selection Sort (n shifts replaced by 1 swap as an optimisation)
